Hi! I'm Mert, a software engineer working at [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io). I'm focusing mainly on engineering for the web and open source. I'm a big fan of continuous learning. I love solving algorithmic puzzles, writing open source code and contributing to projects on GitHub. You can find all of my projects here. They all are open source.
